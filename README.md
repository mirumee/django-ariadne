# Django Ariadne (moved)

This repo was intended to contain utilities simplifying the process of adding [Ariadne](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne) GraphQL APIs to Django projects but we have decided that those utils should be part of main repo instead.

Starting with 0.4 release, Ariadne provides `ariadne.contrib.django` package that implements utilities originally intended for this package.
